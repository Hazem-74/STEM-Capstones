# Martyr Mohamed Hossam Floating Bridge  
Grade 10 Capstone Project | Sharkia STEM School | 2019–2020

SDGs: SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)

## Problem Statement
Urban congestion in Dakahlia Governorate—particularly between Talkha and El Mansoura—is worsened by limited river crossings. Existing bridges are costly, immobile, and concentrated in southern zones, forcing northern residents to rely on slow ferries or detours exceeding 2 km.

## Scientific Principles

### Arch Structural Design
The bridge employs an arch configuration to convert vertical loads into compressive forces along the curve, minimizing bending moments and material stress. This design leverages principles of static equilibrium and torque distribution.

### Buoyancy and Hydrostatics
The prototype relies on Archimedes’ principle:  
> *The upward buoyant force equals the weight of displaced fluid.*  

Mathematically:  
\( F_b = \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot g \cdot V_{\text{submerged}} \geq W_{\text{bridge + load}} \)  

A low center of mass ensures rotational stability and prevents capsizing.

### Scaling and Modeling
Geometric similarity was maintained with a scaling factor of 0.3 (1 m in prototype ≈ 100 m in real bridge). Dimensional tolerances were recorded to assess structural robustness.

## Materials and Cost
| Item               | Quantity      | Cost (L.E.) | Cost ($) |
|--------------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Wooden sticks      | 285           | 28.50       | 0.95     |
| Gloss varnish      | 250 g         | 13.75       | 0.46     |
| Superglue          | 9 tubes       | 9.00        | 0.30     |
| Glue gun sticks    | 5             | 7.50        | 0.25     |
| **Total**          | —             | **58.75**   | **1.96** |

## Results
- Maximum supported load: **2.95 kg** (scaled equivalent ≈ 98 metric tons)
