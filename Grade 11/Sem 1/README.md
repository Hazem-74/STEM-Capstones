# Algae-Based Wastewater Reuse System  
Grade 11 Capstone Project | Sharkia STEM School | 2020–2021

SDGs: SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption), SDG 15 (Life on Land)

## Problem Statement
Egypt loses 55.5 billion m³ of freshwater annually due to inefficient irrigation and polluted agricultural drainage. Conventional treatment is energy-intensive and costly.

## Scientific Principles

### Phytoremediation via Chlorophyta (Green Algae)
Algae absorb nitrates (NO₃⁻), phosphates (PO₄³⁻), and heavy metals during photosynthesis:  
$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{light} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$  

This process simultaneously purifies water and produces biomass usable as organic fertilizer.

### Water Quality Metrics
- **pH correction**: from 8.0 to neutral range (7.0–7.4) — **100% efficiency**
- **TDS reduction**: from ~690 ppm to ~272 ppm — **60.54% efficiency**  
  Efficiency formula:  
  $\text{Efficiency} = \frac{|\text{TDS}_{\text{initial}} - \text{TDS}_{\text{final}}|}{\text{TDS}_{\text{initial}}} \times 100\%$

## Materials and Cost
All materials were locally sourced and reused where possible. Total cost was less than 70 L.E. (**< $2.33**).

## Results
- 100% pH correction to irrigation-suitable range
- 60.54% reduction in total dissolved solids (TDS)
- System validated for clay-soil agriculture

## Scientific Concepts Applied
- Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) vs. chemical oxygen demand (COD)
- Ion exchange and nutrient cycling
- Environmental chemistry of eutrophication
- Quantitative analysis (ppm, % efficiency)

## Real-World Impact
This low-tech, solar-powered system enables circular water management in rural farms, reducing freshwater extraction and chemical fertilizer dependency.
