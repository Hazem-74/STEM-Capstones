# STEM Capstone Projects  
**STEM High School SGD (Sustainable Development Goals) Projects**  
*Sharkia STEM School — Grades 10 to 12 (2019–2022)*

This repository documents student-led engineering and scientific capstone projects developed to address Egypt’s grand challenges through the lens of the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. Each project integrates physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, computer science, and engineering design to deliver innovative, low-cost, and eco-friendly solutions.


## Featured Projects

### 1. **Martyr Mohamed Hossam Floating Bridge**  
**Grade 10 | 2019–2020**  
> *"Solving urban congestion through smart infrastructure."*

- **Problem**: Urban congestion and limited river crossings in Dakahlia Governorate (e.g., between Talkha and El Mansoura) force residents to rely on slow ferries or long detours.
- **Solution**: A low-cost, modular **floating bridge** using **arch design** to distribute load and minimize material use.
- **Prototype**: Built with two pontoons, wooden sticks, and eco-friendly materials (total cost: **58.75 EGP**).
- **Results**: Supported up to **2.95 kg** with minimal vertical displacement; achieved **high efficiency, safety, and affordability**.
- **SDGs Addressed**:  
  [SDG 9] Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure  
  [SDG 11] Sustainable Cities and Communities


### 2. **Algae-Based Wastewater Reuse System**  
**Grade 11 | 2020–2021**  
> *"Turning agricultural drainage into a resource."*

- **Problem**: Egypt wastes **55.5 billion m³** of clean water annually through inefficient irrigation and polluted drainage.
- **Solution**: Use **Chlorophyta (green algae)** to naturally purify agricultural wastewater by absorbing nitrates, phosphates, and heavy metals—then reuse the cleaned water for irrigation.
- **Prototype**: Simulated farmland with algae-filled canal and irrigation system.
- **Results**:  
  - **100% pH correction** (from 8.0 → 7.0–7.4)  
  - **60.54% reduction in TDS** (Total Dissolved Solids)
- **Benefits**: Eco-friendly, low-cost, and doubles as organic soil fertilizer.
- **SDGs Addressed**:  
  [SDG 6] Clean Water and Sanitation  
  [SDG 12] Responsible Consumption and Production  
  [SDG 15] Life on Land

### 3. **Automonitor Trough System (Concentrated Solar Power)**  
**Grade 12 | 2021–2022**  
> *"Boosting solar thermal efficiency with smart control."*

- **Problem**: CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) plants consume significant electricity to run feedwater pumps continuously—even when thermal oil is hot enough.
- **Solution**: An **Arduino-based monitoring and control system** that:
  - Uses **temperature sensors** to activate the pump only when needed.
  - Employs **Wi-Fi (RemoteXY)** for real-time monitoring.
  - Includes **sun-tracking** via LDRs and stepper motors.
- **Prototype**: Parabolic trough with acrylic mirror, copper receiver tube, and thermal oil circulation.
- **Results**:  
  - **15.21% reduction in electrical energy consumption**  
  - Same steam output, less pump runtime (92s → 78s)
- **Real-World Impact**: Could save **145.56 kW** in a 50 MW plant like *Andasol 3*.
- **SDGs Addressed**:  
  [SDG 7] Affordable and Clean Energy  
  [SDG 9] Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure  
  [SDG 13] Climate Action

## Vision & Impact
These projects demonstrate how **STEM education empowers youth** to tackle national challenges—from water scarcity and urban planning to renewable energy—using **scientific inquiry, engineering design, and digital innovation**.

All solutions prioritize:
- Low cost & local materials  
- Environmental sustainability  
- Scalability to real-world implementation
